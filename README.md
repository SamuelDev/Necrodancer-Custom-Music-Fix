Fixing the beatdown.exe processed file names

If you want to download this fix, click "Download ZIP" in the bottom right corner of the page.

You my or may not have noticed that in the custom music folder, there is a program called beatdown.exe.  This is the software that detects the beats in your custom music, giving you the movement pattern in the game.

If you run this program from the folder, it will generate processed files for all of the songs in that folder, allowing you to process all of your songs at once, instead of one by one as you select them from in the game.

The issue though, is that it names the files differently when you process them out of the game, versus from in the game.  While you could go through and rename each song manually, when you are using upwards of 100+ songs, this process would take too long.

I threw together a quick fix so I could process all of my songs in one go, and I am releasing it for everyone else to use if they want.
